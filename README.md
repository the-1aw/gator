# Gator 🐊

gator is RSS feed management cli built for leaning purposes.

## Improvements

- [ ] Make the README decent
- [ ] Refactor single file cli.go
- [ ] Use timestamp instead of dates for created_at and updated_at filed
- [ ] Use sql default value for uuid and timestamp to reduce code clutter
- [ ] Make sql error user friendly

- [ ] Add an HTTP API (and authentication/authorization) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
- [ ] Write a service manager that keeps the agg command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes
